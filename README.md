# dotfiles

This is the VM that I work in. It contains my configurations of vim, tmux, fish and more. On my Mac, there are no developer tools installed except Vagrant, VirtualBox, iTerm2, and the Xcode Command Line Tools. My dotfiles contains a Vagrantfile to provision the Vagrant box running in VirtualBox with Ansible. So when I want to start developing on my machine, I do a `vagrant up && vagrant ssh` and then I work inside the Vagrant box. From time to time I run a `vagrant destroy` to keep everything clean. I use US-Extended as my keyboard layout (The German keyboard layout doesn't work for me).

I'm using [Solarized Light](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) as my color scheme. My font of choice is [Input](http://input.fontbureau.com) in 11px. I then work in full screen mode. This is how the entire thing looks like:

## fish

I'm using [fish](http://fishshell.com) as my shell. I noticed that it does a lot of things I needed to configure in ZSH by default and switched to it. The only thing I configured is that I use [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), because I really missed `Ctrl+r` for reverse searching and I like the incremental search.

The prompt is a tiny arrow (or a âœ¦ when there are jobs in the background) that is green when the last status exit was 0, and red otherwise. In the right prompt, I display the pwd and the current git status. I have a few aliases, scripts and functions:

* With `j` I can jump to my Code projects
* To start or continue working on a project, I use my tiny `s` function which starts (or attaches to) a tmux session for a project with the correct start directory.
* `l` is just `ls -al`
* `generate_cert` generates a TLS certificate
* `mdoutline` shows the outline of a Markdown document (only works correctly, if you don't use the 'underline' variant for headlines)
* `rabbit` enforces an NTP sync
* `serve` serve the current directory via HTTP
* `gb` is a prettier `git branch`
* `gl` is a prettier `git log`
* `postgres` and `redis` start a temporary fresh PostgreSQL or Redis instance in a docker container

## tmux

Use tmux, it rocks! I configured it with some more Vim-like bindings and a nice status bar with the current time and battery charge (via `acpi`).

## Vim

I'm doing all my programming and most of my writing in vim. I use the following plugins:

* A few **nice defaults** via [`tpope/vim-sensible`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible)
* Additional **language support** loaded on demand via [`sheerun/vim-polyglot`](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot)
* Minimalistic **commenting** via [`tpope/vim-commentary`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)
* **Quoting/Parenthesizing** made simple via [`tpope/vim-surround`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
* Enable **repeat** for Surround and Commentary via [`tpope/vim-repeat`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat)
* **Peace in the office** via [`editorconfig/editorconfig-vim`](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim)
* On-the-fly **formatting, linting feedback and LSP support** via [`w0rp/ale`](https://github.com/w0rp/ale)
* Fuzzy **file finder** with [`junegunn/fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

## Other commandline tools

* [`git`](https://www.git-scm.com) is the only version control system I use. It has an amazing companion: [`tig`](http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig)
* [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is a replacement for grep that is so fast, that I can't really believe it
* [`jq`](http://stedolan.github.io/jq) is like `sed` for JSON data, but I mostly use it for pretty printing
* [`tree`](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree) prints the folder structure as a tree
* [`wget`](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget) and [`curl`](http://curl.haxx.se)
* [`pry`](http://pryrepl.org) is a replacement for Ruby's IRB with `amazing_print`
* [`ragel`](http://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel) is a beautiful state machine compiler
* [`youtube-dl`](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl) allows me to download videos for train trips
* [`docker`](https://www.docker.com) and `docker-compose` because I really wish it would do what I want
* [`shellcheck`](https://www.shellcheck.net) to get feedback about shell scripts
* [`asciinema`](https://asciinema.org) to record terminal things
* [`electric_monk`](https://github.com/moonglum/electric_monk) to check if I have unpushed changes anywhere
* [`direnv`](https://direnv.net) to load and unload environment variables depending on the current directory

## Languages I work or play with

The programming languages I use regularly are installed via `asdf` so I can switch versions and always be on the most recent release.

* I write Ruby, JavaScript/TypeScript (Node, Browser or Deno) and CSS almost daily
* Currently working in a Go project
* Playing around with Rust, just because Go frustrates me so deeply

## Making GPG available in the box

*Thanks for @bascht for helping me setting this up.*

On my Mac, I have [GPGTools](https://gpgtools.org) installed to write and receive GPG encryped emails. The GPG agent on my Mac is configured to create an extra GPG socket.

```
# ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
default-cache-ttl 300
max-cache-ttl 999999
enable-ssh-support
extra-socket /Users/moonglum/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent.extra
```

SSH is then configured to forward that extra socket to the virtual machine:

```
# ~/.ssh/config
Host 127.0.0.1
  RemoteForward /var/run/user/1000/gnupg/S.gpg-agent /Users/moonglum/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent.extra
  ExitOnForwardFailure yes
```

In addition to that, the host and machine share the pubring.gpg and trustdb.gpg. They are both in the folder of this repo (but gitignored), and then linked to the according locations.
