# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. They contain my configurations of vim, tmux, ZSH and more. On my Mac, there are no developer tools installed except Vagrant, Packer, VirtualBox, Ansible, iTerm 2 and Xcode. My dotfiles contains a Vagrantfile to provision the Vagrant box running in VirtualBox, provisioned by Ansible. So when I want to start developing on my machine, I do a `vagrant up && vagrant ssh` and then I work inside the Vagrant box. From time to time I run a `vagrant destroy` to keep everything clean.

I'm using [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) as my color scheme. It's just beautiful. My font of choice is [Fira Mono](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira) ([Nerd Font patched](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)) in 12px. I then work in full screen mode. This is how the entire looks like:

## ZSH

My ZSH setup is quite minimal, nothing special going on here. Just standard stuff like activating auto complete, syntax highlighting, adjusting the PATH and a handful of aliases and tiny functions.

The smiley represents the exit status of the last executed command. On the right side it displays information about the current directory and the Git status.

I adjusted the Jump plugin from Oh-my-ZSH to my needs. With `j` I can jump to directories I visit often. This includes their subdirectories, with autocomplete.

## tmux

Use tmux, it rocks!
I configured it with some more Vim-like bindings and a powerline-inspired status bar.

I also use [tmuxinator](https://github.com/aziz/tmuxinator) to setup my development sessions.

## Vim

I use vim in the terminal, because of tmux. I'm doing all my programming (currently that's Ruby and JavaScript most of the time) and most of my writing (in Latex and Markdown) here. I'm using Pathogen for my plugin management (and Ansible to install them). It's great. I use the following plugins:

* Additional **language support** loaded on demand via [`sheerun/vim-polyglot`](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot)
* Minimalistic **commenting** via [`tpope/vim-commentary`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)
* **Quoting/Parenthesizing** made simple via [`tpope/vim-surround`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
* Enable **repeat** for Surround and Commentary via [`tpope/vim-repeat`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat)
* **Peace in the office** via [`editorconfig/editorconfig-vim`](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim)
* On-the-fly **linting feedback** via [`benekastah/neomake`](https://github.com/benekastah/neomake)

## Other commandline tools

* [`git`](https://www.git-scm.com) is the only version control system I use. It has three amazing companions: [`hub`](http://hub.github.com), [`tig`](http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig) and [`commitizen`](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli)
* `ag` aka. [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) is a replacement for grep that is so fast, that I can't really believe it.
* [`htop`](https://github.com/max-horvath/htop-osx) is a replacement for `top`.
* [`jq`](http://stedolan.github.io/jq) is like `sed` for JSON data.
* [`tree`](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree) prints the folder structure as a tree.
* [`wget`](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget) and [`curl`](http://curl.haxx.se)
* [`alex`](http://alexjs.com) to catch insensitive, inconsiderate writing.
* [`pry`](http://pryrepl.org) is a replacement for Ruby's IRB
* [`semantic-release-cli`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) helps to set up NPM packages that automatically get released.

## Languages I work or play with

* Ruby and JavaScript (Daily)
* I used Haskell and Prolog quite a lot in University
* I'm also playing around with Elixir, Rust and Elm

## Miscellaneous

* My terminal emulator of choice is [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com).
* I use US-Extended as my keyboard layout. The German keyboard layout is useless.
* When coding, I listen to the following music: Tron Legacy OST, Starcraft II OST, Diablo III OST, Octabitron, Saor Patrol, Schelmish, ZoÃ« Keating, Au4, Daft Punk, LukHash, Monument Valley OST, Les Revenants OST, Apocalyptica, VNV Nation...
